## Setup a dev environment

Bellow are the steps to create a dev environment. Examples bellow will use Endurain repo, but you should adapt those for your scenario (forked repo, etc).

 - Clone the repo to your dev machine:

```
$ cd <folder_to_store_code>
$ git clone https://github.com/joaovitoriasilva/endurain.git # this will clone the repo structure to the previous folder inside a folder called endurain
```

### Docker image and backend logic
Make sure Docker is installed, more info [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/).

 - On the project root folder, create a new Docker image, the example bellow uses `unified-image` as the image name:

```
$ docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t unified-image .
```

 - Go to the project root folder and create a file called `docker-compose.yml` and adapt it to your needs. Example bellow:

```
services:
    endurain:
        container_name: endurain
        image: unified-image # based on image that will be created above
        environment:
            - TZ=Europe/Lisbon # change if needed. Default is UTC
            - DB_TYPE=postgres
            - DB_HOST=postgres
            - DB_PORT=5432
            - DB_PASSWORD=changeme
            - SECRET_KEY=changeme # openssl rand -hex 32
            - FERNET_KEY=changeme # https://fernetkeygen.com or python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
            - GEOCODES_MAPS_API=changeme
            - ENDURAIN_HOST=http://localhost:8080 # change if needed
            - BEHIND_PROXY=false
            - ENVIRONMENT=development
        volumes:
            - <path_to_project_root_folder>/backend/app:/app/backend # this will replace the backend code logic with yours. Any changes in the code need a container reboot for them to apply
        ports:
            - "8080:8080" # change if needed
        depends_on:
            postgres:
                condition: service_healthy
        restart: unless-stopped

    postgres:
        image: postgres:latest
        container_name: postgres
        environment:
            - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme
            - POSTGRES_DB=endurain
            - POSTGRES_USER=endurain
            - PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
        ports:
            - "5432:5432"
        healthcheck:
            test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U endurain"]
            interval: 5s
            timeout: 5s
            retries: 5
        volumes:
            - <path_to_container_folders>/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        restart: unless-stopped

    adminer:
        container_name: adminer
        image: adminer
        ports:
            - 8081:8080
        restart: unless-stopped
```

 - Start your project based on the docker compose file created before:

```
$ docker compose up -d
```

 - To stop the project:

```
$ docker compose down
```

 - To remove the create `unified-image` Docker image:

```
$ docker image remove unified-image
```

 - Backend uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. You may need to install Python and Poetry if dependency management is necessary.

### Frontend
Make sure you have an up-to-date version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

 - Go to the root of the project and move to frontend/app folder and install the dependencies:

```
$ cd frontend/app
$ npm install
```

 - Create a file called `.env.local` inside frontend/app and add the following to it:

```
VITE_ENDURAIN_HOST=http://localhost:8080 # Adapt this based on the docker compose of your dev environment
```

 - After the dependencies are installed run the frontend:

```
$ npm run dev
```

 - After the frontend starts running, it should be available in the port `5173`. You should now be able to access the dev environment at `http://localhost:5173`. Screenshot bellow shows the output from the `npm run dev`. Adapt the port based on the command output.

![Frontend running](assets/developer-guide/npm_run_dev.png)

 - Some processes, like token refresh may redirect your dev env from port `5173` to `8080` (or other, depending on your compose file). If this happens simply navigate again to `5173`.

## API Integration (v0.3.0+)

Endurain supports integration with other apps:

### API Requirements
- **Add a header:** Every request must include an `X-Client-Type` header with either `web` or `mobile` as the value. Requests with other values will receive a `403` error.
- **Authorization:** Every request must include an `Authorization Bearer: <access token>` header with a valid (new or refreshed) access token.

### Token Handling
- The backend will generate an `access_token` valid for 15 minutes and an `refresh_token` valid for 7 days. This follow the logic of short and longed lived tokens for auth session.
- The `access_token` is used for authorization; The `refresh_token` is used to refresh the `access_token`.
- For **web apps**, the backend sends access/refresh tokens as HTTP-only cookies.
- For **mobile apps**, tokens are included in the response body.


### API Endpoints 
The API is reachable under `/api/v1`. Below are some example endpoints. All endpoints information can be checked on the backend docs (`http://localhost:98/docs` or `http://ip_address:98/docs` or `https://domain/docs`):

| What | Url | Expected Information |
| ---- | --- | -------------------- |
| **Authorize** | `/token` |  `FORM` with the fields `username` and `password`. This will be sent in clear text, use of HTTPS is highly recommended |
| **Refresh Token** | `/refresh` | header `Authorization Bearer: <Refresh Token>`  |
| **Activity Upload** | `/activities/create/upload` | .gpx, .tcx, .gz or .fit file |
| **Set Weight** | `/health/weight` | JSON {'weight': <number>, 'created_at': `yyyy-MM-dd`} |

### MFA Authentication Flow

When Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for a user, the authentication process requires two steps:

#### Step 1: Initial Login Request
Make a standard login request to `/token`:

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/v1/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
X-Client-Type: web|mobile

username=user@example.com&password=userpassword
```

**Response (when MFA is enabled):**
- **Web clients**: HTTP 202 Accepted
  ```json
  {
    "mfa_required": true,
    "username": "example",
    "message": "MFA verification required"
  }
  ```
- **Mobile clients**: HTTP 200 OK
  ```json
  {
    "mfa_required": true,
    "username": "example",
    "message": "MFA verification required"
  }
  ```

#### Step 2: MFA Verification
Complete the login by providing the MFA code to `/mfa/verify`:

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/v1/mfa/verify
Content-Type: application/json
X-Client-Type: web|mobile

{
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "mfa_code": "123456"
}
```

**Response (successful verification):**
- **Web clients**: Tokens are set as HTTP-only cookies
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "unique_session_id"
  }
  ```
- **Mobile clients**: Tokens are returned in response body
  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "eyJ...",
    "refresh_token": "eyJ...",
    "session_id": "unique_session_id"
  }
  ```

#### Error Handling
- **No pending MFA login**: HTTP 400 Bad Request
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "No pending MFA login found for this username"
  }
  ```
- **Invalid MFA code**: HTTP 401 Unauthorized
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "Invalid MFA code"
  }
  ```

#### Important Notes
- The pending MFA login session is temporary and will expire if not completed within a reasonable time
- After successful MFA verification, the pending login is automatically cleaned up
- The user must still be active at the time of MFA verification
- If no MFA is enabled for the user, the standard single-step authentication flow applies

## Bulk import

When items are imported either through a bulk import or Strava bulk import, the dictionary "import_info" is created for the activity to record information on the import.

The import_info dictionary should include at least the following fields:
* imported (boolean)
* import_source (str) - e.g., "Strava bulk import" or "Basic bulk import"
* strava_activity_id (int) - holds Strava's internal activity ID for Strava activities when imported from a bulk Strava import
* import_ISO_time (str)

If this dictionary exists the file was imported with one of those two functions.  Checking the "imported" field double-checks this.

These fields allow determination of when files were imported (to facilitate creation of the ability to roll back an import), and also allow separation of imported Strava activities from Strava activities added via linking with Strava as a service.
