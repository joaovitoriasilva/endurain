The primary motivation behind this project was to gain hands-on experience and expand my understanding of modern development practices. Second motivation is that I'm an amateur triathlete and I want to keep track of my gear and gear components usage.</p> <p>If you have any recommendations or insights on improving any aspect of Endurain, whether related to technology choices, user experience, or any other relevant area, I would greatly appreciate your input. The goal is to create a reliable and user-friendly fitness tracking solution that caters to the needs of individuals who prefer self-hosted applications. Your constructive feedback will undoubtedly contribute to the refinement of Endurain.</p>"},{"location":"#features","title":"Features","text":"<p>Endurain currently supports:</p> <ul> <li>Multi-user functionality with admin and user profiles adaptable interfaces</li> <li>Activity import via manual or bulk upload (.gpx, .tcx and .fit files. .fit files are preferred)</li> <li>Strava integration for syncing activities and gear</li> <li>Garmin Connect integration for syncing activities, gear and body composition</li> <li>Activity feeds and statistics (week/month)</li> <li>Basic activity privacy settings</li> <li>Gear tracking (wetsuits, bicycles, shoes, racquets, skis, snowboards)</li> <li>Gear component tracking (e.g., track when components like bike chains need replacing)</li> <li>Default gear for activity types</li> <li>User pages with stats and activity histories</li> <li>Follower features (view activities)</li> <li>Multi-language support</li> <li>Imperial and metric units support</li> <li>Dark/light theme switcher</li> <li>Third-party app support</li> <li>Weight, steps and sleep logging</li> <li>Notification system</li> <li>Define and track goals</li> <li>MFA TOTP support</li> <li>Password reset through email link.
