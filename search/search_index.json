What is Endurain? Endurain is a self-hosted fitness tracking service designed to give users full control over their data and hosting environment. Built with: Frontend: Vue.js, Notivue and Bootstrap CSS Backend: Python FastAPI, Alembic, SQLAlchemy, stravalib and python-garminconnect for Strava and Garmin Connect integration, gpxpy and fitdecode for .gpx and .fit file import respectively Database: MariaDB or PostgreSQL for efficient data management Observability: Jaeger for basic tracing and monitoring To deploy Endurain, a Docker image is available, and a comprehensive example can be found in the \"docker-compose.yml.example\" file provided in the project repository. Configuration is facilitated through environment variables, ensuring flexibility and ease of customization. Developer's Note As a non-professional developer, my journey with Endurain involved learning and implementing new technologies and concepts, with invaluable assistance from ChatGPT. The primary motivation behind this project was to gain hands-on experience and expand my understanding of modern development practices. Second motivation is that I'm an amateur triathlete and I want to keep track of my gear and gear components usage. If you have any recommendations or insights on improving any aspect of Endurain, whether related to technology choices, user experience, or any other relevant area, I would greatly appreciate your input. The goal is to create a reliable and user-friendly fitness tracking solution that caters to the needs of individuals who prefer self-hosted applications. Your constructive feedback will undoubtedly contribute to the refinement of Endurain. Features Endurain currently supports: Multi-user functionality with admin and user profiles adaptable interfaces Activity import via manual or bulk upload (.gpx and .fit files. .fit files are preferred) Strava integration for syncing activities and gear Garmin Connect integration for syncing activities, gear and body composition Activity feeds and statistics (week/month) Basic activity privacy settings Gear tracking (wetsuits, bicycles, shoes, racquets) Default gear for activity types User pages with stats and activity histories Follower features (view activities) Multi-language support Imperial and metric units support Dark/light theme switcher Third-party app support Weight logging Planned Features Upcoming features (in no particular order): Live tracking Gear component tracking (e.g., track when components like bike chains need replacing) Activity comments and likes Notification system Potential ActivityPub integration Sponsors A huge thank you to the project sponsors!

On the project root folder, create a new Docker image, the example bellow uses unified-image as the image name: $ docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t unified-image . Go to the project root folder and create a file called docker-compose.yml and adapt it to your needs. Example bellow: services: endurain: container_name: endurain image: unified-image # based on image that will be created above environment: - TZ=Europe/Lisbon # change if needed.

You may need to install Python and Poetry if dependency management is necessary. Frontend Make sure you have an up-to-date version of Node.js installed. Go to the root of the project and move to frontend/app folder and install the dependencies: $ cd frontend/app $ npm install Create a file called .env.local inside frontend/app and add the following to it: VITE_ENDURAIN_HOST=http://localhost:8080 # Adapt this based on the docker compose of your dev environment VITE_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=MY_APP_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID After the dependencies are installed run the frontend: $ npm run dev After the frontend starts running, it should be available in the port 5173 . You should now be able to access the dev environment at http://localhost:5173 . Screenshot bellow shows the output from the npm run dev . Adapt the port based on the command output. Some processes, like token refresh may redirect your dev env from port 5173 to 8080 (or other, depending on your compose file). If this happens simply navigate again to 5173 . API Integration (v0.3.0+) Endurain supports integration with other apps: API Requirements Add a header: Every request must include an X-Client-Type header with either web or mobile as the value. Requests with other values will receive a 403 error. Authorization: Every request must include an Authorization Bearer: <access token> header with a valid (new or refreshed) access token. Token Handling The backend will generate an access_token valid for 15 minutes and an refresh_token valid for 7 days. This follow the logic of short and longed lived tokens for auth session. The access_token is used for authorization; The refresh_token is used to refresh the access_token . For web apps , the backend sends access/refresh tokens as HTTP-only cookies. For mobile apps , tokens are included in the response body. API Endpoints The API is reachable under /api/v1 . Below are some example endpoints. All endpoints information can be checked on the backend docs ( http://localhost:98/docs or http://ip_address:98/docs or https://domain/docs ): What Url Expected Information Authorize /token FORM with the fields username and password .
