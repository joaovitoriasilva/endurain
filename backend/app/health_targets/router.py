    Retrieve all health targets for the authenticated user.

    This endpoint fetches all health targets associated with the user identified by the

    Args:
        _check_scopes (Callable): Security dependency that verifies the user has the
            required 'health:read' scope. The underscore prefix indicates this parameter
            is injected by FastAPI's security system but not directly used in the function.
        token_user_id (int): The user ID extracted from the JWT access token, automatically
            injected by the authentication dependency.
        db (Session): SQLAlchemy database session dependency for executing database queries.

    Returns:
        health_targets_schema.HealthTargets | None: The health targets object containing
            all targets for the user, or None if no targets are found.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: May raise 401 Unauthorized if the token is invalid or expired.
