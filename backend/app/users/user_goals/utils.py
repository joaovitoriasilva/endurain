def get_start_end_date_by_interval(
    interval: str, date: str
) -> tuple[datetime, datetime]:
    """
    Return the start and end datetimes for the interval containing the given date.

    Parameters
    ----------
    interval : str
        One of "yearly", "monthly", "weekly", or "daily". Determines how the window is aligned:
        - "yearly": calendar year containing the date
        - "monthly": calendar month containing the date
        - "weekly": ISO week starting on Monday containing the date
        - "daily": the given calendar day
    date : str
        Date string in "YYYY-MM-DD" format. This is parsed with datetime.strptime(date, "%Y-%m-%d").

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[datetime, datetime]
        A pair (start_date, end_date) where:
        - start_date is the beginning of the requested interval (00:00:00 on the start day),
        - end_date is the last second of the requested interval (23:59:59 on the end day).
        Both datetimes are naive (no tzinfo) and use second precision.

    Raises
    ------
    HTTPException
        Raises an HTTPException with status_code=400 if an unsupported interval string is provided.

    Notes
    -----
    - "yearly": start is January 1st of the date's year at 00:00:00; end is the last second of December 31st.
    - "monthly": start is the first day of the month at 00:00:00; end is the last second of that month.
    - "weekly": start is the Monday of the week at 00:00:00; end is the following Sunday at 23:59:59.
    - "daily": start is the date at 00:00:00; end is the date at 23:59:59.
    - The implementation computes month/year boundaries by advancing to the next period and
      subtracting one second; if you need timezone-aware behavior or sub-second precision,
      convert inputs/outputs to timezone-aware datetimes and adjust the logic accordingly.
