class TestPasswordHasherSecurity:
    """
    Test suite for the PasswordHasher class and related password security functionality.

    This class contains comprehensive tests to ensure the correctness, security, and policy enforcement
    of password hashing, verification, password generation, and password validation logic. The tests cover:

    - Initialization of PasswordHasher with various types of hashers (None, single hasher, iterable, PasswordHash instance, incorrect types).
    - Hashing and verifying passwords, including correct, incorrect, case-sensitive, very long, and Unicode passwords.
    - Ensuring that password hashes are unique and non-empty.
    - Verifying and updating password hashes when algorithms change.
    - Password generation, including length requirements, character class inclusion, and uniqueness.
    - Password validation, enforcing policy requirements such as minimum length, presence of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
    - Handling of edge cases such as empty passwords, whitespace-only passwords, and custom minimum length requirements.
    - Ensuring proper error handling and exception raising for invalid inputs and policy violations.

    Each test asserts the expected behavior and error handling to guarantee robust password security mechanisms.
