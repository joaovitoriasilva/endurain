# Endurain Trademark Policy

_Last updated: 2025-10-17_

"**Endurain**" (the **Word Mark**) is a claimed trademark of **João Vitória Silva** (the **Owner**).
An application to register this word mark with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) is currently pending.  
Until registration is granted, the mark should be referred to as **Endurain™**.

The **Endurain logo** and related visual identity elements (the **Logos**) are original design works owned by João Vitória Silva and protected by copyright and design rights, but they are **not yet registered as separate trademarks**.

This policy explains when and how you may use the Endurain name and Logos.  
It exists alongside the software’s license (AGPLv3). **The AGPLv3 covers the code; this policy covers the branding.**

## 1. Philosophy

Endurain is open source and encourages self-hosting.  
I want individuals, communities, and non-profits to freely use the **Endurain™** name and logo for non-commercial purposes.  
At the same time, I reserve the right to control **commercial use** of the brand.

## 2. Permitted Use Without Permission

You **may** use the Endurain™ name and Logos in the following cases:

- **Personal self-hosting** — running Endurain for yourself, friends, or family.  
- **Community or club hosting** — for sports clubs, local groups, or other non-profit efforts.  
- **Educational use** — teaching, research, or academic projects.  
- **Open-source contributions** — forks, test deployments, and integrations, as long as they are not sold.  
- **Nominative references** — talking about, writing about, or demonstrating Endurain truthfully.

These uses may retain the name **Endurain™** and the official Logos.

**Rules for non-commercial use:**
- Do not imply that your use is officially sponsored or endorsed by the Endurain project.  
- Do not alter the Logos except for reasonable resizing or adapting to backgrounds.  
- Always comply with the AGPLv3 license for the code.  
- Make it clear if your instance or fork is not the official Endurain service.

## 3. Uses That Require Permission

The following uses of the Endurain™ name or Logos require **prior written permission** from the Owner:

- Offering **paid hosting**, **SaaS**, or commercial cloud services under the Endurain name.  
- Selling products or services that prominently use the Endurain name or Logos.  
- Using the Endurain name in a **company name, brand, or product line**.  
- Marketing **commercial support, consulting, or training** under the Endurain name.  
- Registering domains or social media handles that imply official status (e.g., `enduraincloud.com`, `@endurainapp`).  
- Producing merchandise (shirts, stickers, etc.) with the Endurain name or Logos for sale.

For permission requests, contact: [joao@endurain.com](mailto:joao@endurain.com).

## 4. Forks and Distributions

I welcome forks and distributions under the AGPLv3 license.  
If your fork is **non-commercial**, you may keep the Endurain™ name and Logos, provided you:

- Clearly state that it is **not the official Endurain project**.  
- Identify it as “a fork of Endurain” or “based on Endurain.”  
- Do not present yourself as an official maintainer or partner.

If your fork is **commercial** (offering paid hosting, subscriptions, or products), you **must rename it** and **remove the Logos** unless you have written permission.

## 5. Packages, Domains, and Namespaces

- **Package registries** (npm, PyPI, Docker, etc.): Non-commercial packages may use “Endurain” in the name.  
  Commercial or paid offerings may not without permission.  
- **Domains and handles:** Avoid names that could be mistaken for the official project unless approved.

## 6. Prohibited Uses

The Endurain™ name and Logos may **never** be used:

- In any misleading way that implies endorsement or partnership.  
- In connection with illegal activities, malware, or harmful content.  
- To promote or brand competing software as “Endurain” without permission.  
- To sell any service or product under the Endurain name without authorization.

## 7. License vs. Trademark

The AGPLv3 license gives you broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the **code**, including commercially.  
This trademark policy only limits how you use the **name and branding**.

You are free to offer commercial services based on the Endurain code — but you must not market them **under the Endurain name or Logos** unless permitted.

## 8. Attribution

When referring to Endurain in permitted use, include the following notice:

> "Endurain™ is a trademark of João Vitória Silva. Registration pending."

## 9. Reporting Misuse

If you believe the Endurain trademark or branding is being misused, please contact: [joao@endurain.com](mailto:joao@endurain.com).

## 10. Changes

This policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be documented in this file.
